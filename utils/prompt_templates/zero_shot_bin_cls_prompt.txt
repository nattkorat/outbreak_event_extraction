INSTRUCTIONS:
You are an AI text classifier. Your task is to determine if the provided text is primarily about a health-related topic. Read the text carefully and make a binary classification.

Follow these rules:

    1. Analyze the main subject and key topics of the text.

    2. Classify the text as Health-Related if it meets the criteria defined below.

    3. Otherwise, classify it as Not Health-Related.

    4. Your final output must be a single JSON object with the key "is_health_related" and a boolean value (true or false).

CATEGORY DEFINITIONS:

1. Health-Related (true): The text's main focus is on human, animal, or plant health. This includes, but is not limited to:

    - Disease Outbreaks: Mentions of epidemics, pandemics, or clusters of infectious or non-infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19, flu, measles, cancer clusters).

    - Public Health: Government or agency announcements, public health warnings, vaccination campaigns, quarantine measures, safety advisories.

    - Medical Science: Reports on medical research, new treatments, drug trials, clinical studies, or scientific discoveries related to health.

    - Healthcare Services: News about hospitals, clinics, healthcare workers, medical procedures, or health insurance.

    - Symptoms & Conditions: Descriptions of medical symptoms, chronic illnesses, injuries, or public health trends (e.g., rising obesity rates).

2. Not Health-Related (false): The text's main focus is on topics outside of health. This includes:

    - General politics, finance, technology, sports, entertainment, weather, or crime.

    - Exception: If these topics are directly and significantly linked to a health issue (e.g., a political debate about a healthcare bill, an athlete's major injury, a natural disaster causing a disease outbreak), then it should be classified as Health-Related. The health aspect must be a core part of the story.
